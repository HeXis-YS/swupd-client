Release notes draft for next version

Release v3.23.0

This release adds multiple new features and improvements to swupd.

Feature:
 - Add a bundle-remove --force flag to remove a bundle and all bundles that
   depends on it with a single command
 - Add a verbose option to check-update, displaying last version of custom
   formats
 - Improvements in documentation
 - Warn users if latest file isn't signed. Enforcement of signature will come
   next
 - Adds the bundle-info command to show detailed data related to a bundle.
   Among the data currently displayed it includes:
    - If the bundle is installed or not
    - If the bundle is experimental or not
    - If the bundle is up to date (when installed)
    - The latest available version of the bundle
    - The size of the bundle
    - The max size needed in disk to install a bundle if not installed
    - Using the --version flag a user can display bundle information in
      a specific version, not only the current version.
    - Using the --dependencies flag users can show all dependencies of the
      bundle.
    - Using the --files flag users can get the list of files in a bundle.
 - Performance improvement for bundle-remove and bundle-add. Bundle remove is
   significantly faster (more than 90% faster when removing a large number of
   bundles) and bundle-add is around 20% faster for a large number of bundles
   added, running as fast as an os-install for the same bundles.
 - Create an undefined progress status that should be used when there's no
   information on how long an operation will take and use a spinner to display
   that
 - Improve progress report output when --json-output is used to never stop
   in an operation without a spinner or progress bar report.
 - Support enabling and disabling the autoupdate in a chroot using the --path flag
